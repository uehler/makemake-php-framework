# Makemake PHP Framework

**Makemake ist still in a very early stage of development.**

I am working a lot with oop frameworks but I never really new how they
work deep inside their core. So I thought the best way to learn is to
write my own oop php framework.

My goal is a framework which is easy to learn, use and extend.
